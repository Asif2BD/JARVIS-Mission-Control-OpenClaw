You're currently on the `oracle` branch in `/root/.openclaw/workspace/agents/tank/mission-control`\n2. Fetch latest from origin and check if main has any updates we need\n3. If main is behind oracle (our work), that's fine - oracle branch has the latest\n4. Clean up the untracked task files in `.mission-control/tasks/` - these are session artifacts, not code\n5. Check if the Mission Control server runs properly: `cd server && node index.js` (test briefly, then stop)\n6. Report status of the repo and any issues found\n\nRemember: Read GIT-SECURITY-RULES.md - NEVER push to main.",
