  "title": "Integrate agent activity into Mission Control dashboard",
  "description": "Problem: When agents (Tank, Shuri, Keymaker) work on tasks via sessions_spawn, their activity is invisible in Mission Control. The Architect needs real-time visibility of what each agent is doing.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Auto-create tasks in Mission Control when Oracle delegates via sessions_spawn\n2. Stream agent progress/logs to Mission Control (use activity logs or messages/)\n3. Show agent status: idle/working/blocked\n4. Display task completion announcements in the dashboard\n5. Track Oracle's delegation actions as tasks\n\nTechnical approach: Hook into OpenClaw agent sessions, parse session logs/transcripts, and feed updates to Mission Control's activity log and WebSocket broadcasts.\n\nThis is critical for operational visibility.",
