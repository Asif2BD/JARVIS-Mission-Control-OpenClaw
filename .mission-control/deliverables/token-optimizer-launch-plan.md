## 📊 LAUNCH PATTERN ANALYSIS

Successful dev tool launches (like AIsa Skills on ClawHub) follow this formula:
- **Lead with ROI** (cost/time savings in numbers)
- **Show, don't tell** (proof from real usage)
- **One-line install** (remove friction)
- **Community-first** (authentic, not marketing-speak)
- **Timing matters** (stagger platforms, ride momentum)

🦞 Just cut my OpenClaw token costs by 91.67%.

Here's how a single skill reduced my AI agent's LLM spending from thousands to pennies — and why you should install it before your next invoice hits.

🧵 (1/9)

---

The problem: OpenClaw agents are powerful, but they burn through tokens FAST.

Long context windows, constant heartbeats, redundant model calls — it adds up.

My agent Jax was costing me $120/mo. Ouch. (2/9)

---

So I built the OpenClaw Token Optimizer.

Three core optimizations:
• Smart model routing (use cheap models when possible)
• Lazy context loading (only load what's needed)
• Heartbeat optimization (reduce polling overhead)

Result: 85-95% cost reduction. (3/9)

---

Real numbers from agent Jax:

BEFORE:
• 24,000 tokens/session
• Expensive models for everything
• Cost: $120/month

AFTER:
• 2,000 tokens/session  
• Right model for the job
• Cost: $10/month

That's 91.67% savings. (4/9)

---

How it works:

1. Analyzes your agent's task
2. Routes to the cheapest capable model
3. Strips unnecessary context
4. Batches similar operations

All automatic. Zero config changes. (5/9)

---

Installation is one line:

clawhub install Asif2BD/openclaw-token-optimizer

That's it. The skill hooks into OpenClaw's routing layer and starts optimizing immediately.

No code changes. No breaking your setup. (6/9)

---

Security note:

I published this via ClawHub's official registry. No sketchy install scripts, no risky commands.

ClawHub compliance = you can audit the code before running it. (7/9)

---

Supports all major providers:
✅ OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
✅ Anthropic (Claude)
✅ Local models (Ollama, LM Studio)

Works with any OpenClaw setup, any OS. (8/9)

---

If you're running OpenClaw and tired of surprise LLM bills, try it:

Install:
clawhub install Asif2BD/openclaw-token-optimizer

Your wallet will thank you. 🦞💰 (9/9)

### 📱 REDDIT POST (r/OpenClaw, r/LocalLLaMA, r/selfhosted)

**Title:** [Release] OpenClaw Token Optimizer — Cut your agent's LLM costs by 85-95%

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey folks,

I just published a ClawHub skill that's been saving me a ton on OpenClaw token costs. Figured I'd share in case anyone else is getting hammered by LLM bills.

## What it does

The Token Optimizer automatically:
- Routes tasks to the cheapest capable model (no more GPT-4 for simple responses)
- Strips unnecessary context from prompts (lazy loading)
- Optimizes heartbeat intervals (reduces polling overhead)
- Batches similar operations

## Real results

My agent Jax went from **24,000 tokens/session** to **2,000 tokens/session**.

That's a **91.67% reduction** in costs. Went from ~$120/mo to ~$10/mo.

## Installation

One command:
```
clawhub install Asif2BD/openclaw-token-optimizer
```

No config changes needed. It hooks into OpenClaw's routing layer automatically.

## Why I built this

I love OpenClaw, but the token costs were getting out of hand. Long context windows, constant heartbeats, redundant calls — it adds up fast.

I wanted something that would optimize transparently without breaking my existing setup or requiring me to rewrite prompts.

## Security

Published via ClawHub's official registry (no risky install scripts). Code is auditable before you run it.

- **Docs:** Included in the skill package

If you try it, drop a comment with your before/after numbers. Would love to see how much we can save as a community!

Happy optimizing 🦞

🚀 How I Reduced AI Agent Operating Costs by 91%

Last month, I faced a problem many AI developers encounter: skyrocketing LLM costs.

My OpenClaw agent was brilliant — and expensive. Token usage was through the roof, and cloud bills were growing faster than ROI.

So I built the OpenClaw Token Optimizer.

The approach:
✅ Smart model routing (use the right tool for the job)
✅ Lazy context loading (only what's needed)
✅ Heartbeat optimization (reduce redundant calls)

The results:
📉 91.67% cost reduction
📊 24,000 → 2,000 tokens per session
💰 $120/mo → $10/mo

This isn't about cutting corners. It's about intelligent resource allocation. Why use GPT-4 for a simple acknowledgment when GPT-3.5-turbo works fine?

For teams deploying AI agents at scale, these optimizations compound fast. 10 agents × 90% savings = real budget impact.

The skill is now live on ClawHub (OpenClaw's official skill registry). One-line installation, zero configuration.

If you're running AI agents and watching your LLM costs climb, this might help.
